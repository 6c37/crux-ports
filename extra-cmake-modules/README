In order to let ECM work,you need to install Sphinx at first. For now, you can install it using pip2 in root user, or _sudo_

	* pip2 install --upgrade Sphinx
or
	* pip2 install -U Sphinx

more info see Sphinx webpage http://sphinx-doc.org/

Tips: Sphinx needs too many python packages as dependencies which are not listed in crux repo. That's why we manage it using pip(2).
