I made a small tool that recompiles all packages:
https://github.com/onodera-punpun/bin/blob/master/allmk

Packages that failed with GCC 5.1:
* core/ncurses
  - fixed with https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-libs/ncurses/files/ncurses-5.9-gcc-5.patch
* core/binutils
  - fixed by changing the version to 2.25
