The default option controlled by auto.def file is to build documentation 
files, which needs docbook-xsl as a build dependency. If you don't want 
to build documentation, you can set "--disable-doc" in the Pkgfile, then 
(re)build neomutt with ingoring footprint. 

The domain internalization using GNU libidn feature is disabled by 
default. If you want to that feature, try install libidn first, remove 
"--disable-idn" configure flags from Pkgfile and (re)build neomutt with 
ignoring footprint.
