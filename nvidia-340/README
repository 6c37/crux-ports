*** NOTE for nvidia with udev ***

If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to
use the nvidia devices required for 3d to function properly.

POST-INSTALL

Use opt/gl-select from ports to select the correct gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

	# gl-select use nvidia

POST-REMOVE

Use opt/gl-select from ports to revert to the xorg gl/glx libraries
and extensions like so:

	# gl-select use xorg

When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the nvidia port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to xorg and then re-select nvidia in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

	# prt-get update nvidia
	# gl-select use xorg; gl-select use nvidia
