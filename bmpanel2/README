For multihead setups, it uses xorg-libxinerama instead of xorg-libxrandr
by default, that is:
		-DBMPANEL2_FEATURE_XRANDR=OFF
		-DBMPANEL2_FEATURE_XINERAMA=ON
So if you want to use xorg-libxrandr only, or use both for multihead 
setups, make sure you have either package, or both installed, appened 
your changed settings after cmake line, ignore signature and footprint,  
then (re)install.
