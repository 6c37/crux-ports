- Use scim or fcitx as your first choice because it's kinda WIP to get it worked.
- Ibus needs non-POSIX and non-C locales, please generate locales first.
- Add the following to your ~/.xinitrc:

	export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
	export GTK_IM_MODULE="ibus"
	export QT_IM_MODULE="xim"
	LANG=`your langauge` scim -d -x

- Run `ibus-setup` to configure it.
- For language support, file an issue at #6c37 .
